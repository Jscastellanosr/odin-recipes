    <h2>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.</h2>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</p>

    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</p>
    
    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</p>
 
    <b>Step 4</b>
    <p>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</p>
