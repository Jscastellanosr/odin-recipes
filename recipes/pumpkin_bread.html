    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 8-1/2x4-1/2-inch loaf pan.</p>

    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>Combine flour, baking soda, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</p>
    
    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>Beat eggs, white sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Beat in pumpkin and oil. Add flour mixture; mix until batter is blended and smooth.</p>
 
    <b>Step 4</b>
    <p>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</p>

    <b>Step 5</b>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dark brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 70 minutes. Let cool in the pan, about 30 minutes. Invert onto a wire rack and slice it into 1-inch thick slices.</p>
